        <strong>First Paragraph Goes Here.</strong> The headline, the setup, the introduction of issues and project development. For a blog post, you’re introducing the topic and necessary background information to your reader. You’re laying out your case. At the end of the introduction, the issue (inciting incident) is revealed. The reader is made aware of a problem, which should make them curious about it if you’ve made them care or be concerned enough in your introduction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Second Paragraph Goes Here.</strong> This is where you build your case. The reader has the background info, and knows of the problem and progress. Here is where you begin fleshing that out and building in detail. Use facts, charts, quotes, links — but whatever you use, be sure that it doesn’t numb and disinterest the reader. You want to keep them reading. Include resources that proved helpful in sorting the issues (stack overflow, screenshots, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Third Paragraph Goes Here.</strong> Present how you worked through the issues and developed the projects and challenges. How did you overcome the difficulties you had and what resources aided you in your task. Ask yourself, "how could I improve on the solution?" and engage the reader in a question.
