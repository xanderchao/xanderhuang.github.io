          After passing the first week of learning about Ruby methods and solving simple challenges, this week finally revealed the flexibility of Ruby and programming languages.
          We covered instance variables and realized just recently that we have been creating instance methods. In one of the challenges, `Validate Credit Card`, we covered
          classes and instance variables. The goal of this challenge is to return true or false 
        </p>

          Now that we understand a bit about arrays and hashes, let's see what type of ordered lists would use arrays and unordered lists for hashes. Let's say we're going to buy groceries, we would need to create a list of the items we need to buy and so we use an array to store it. `groceries_array = ["apple", "milk", "butter"]` is an array containing three items. When we get to the grocery store, we would type `groceries_array` and this would print all the items in the array. We see how that can be helpful to store a longer list, but what if we needed three apples and two gallons of milk? This is where a hash would be useful, so lets try using a hash for storing quantities as values and the item names as keys. We would type `groceries_hash = {:apples => 3, :milk=> 2, :butter => 1}` and after we retrieve the entire list by typing `groceries_hash`.

          While learning about arrays and hashes, we may run into difficulties. A great resource is <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/">Ruby-Docs</a>. Ruby-docs provides a list of methods paired with examples. Chris Pine's Learn To Program is a great reading on explaining the concepts. Give it a try and it will be worth it!
