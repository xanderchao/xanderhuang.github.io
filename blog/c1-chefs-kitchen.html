      My take on the DBC experience is limited. Based on the attitude Shareef is promoting, he wants developers to come in with an open mind and not compare each other based on relative skills. Don't treat it as a packaged experience. Rather he promotes the idea of self exploration as well as collaborative exploration and potentially discover something about ourselves. Learning a lot and fast can be done together and that's where we're headed. I'm all for that! I've never pair-programmed before and it makes me a bit nervous. I believe it is a great method for improving, but what if I end up being dragged because I'm learning something a bit slow? I'm going to let the journey take me somewhere and embrace what I can gain from this. The culture and environment sound super exciting and I can't wait! I found it interesting how Shareef uses the pomodoro technique when he goes on tangent explorations. We all procrastinate and he embraces it by letting his mind wander on the subject for a set time. It seems I have underestimated the ways I can use this technique, so I'll try and practice this.
