          In Phase 0 of week 3, we learned Ruby and solved exercises using Ruby. This was a interesting and fun week because we finally got into the server side scripting. In some of the challenges, we practiced with arrays and hashes. Arrays and hashes appear to behave similarly in structure, but if you look closer they don't behave the same. Arrays are used to store data in an ordered list format to find elements that are inside easily. Let's set `list_array` as an array and if there were two elements inside, to call one of them you would type `list_array[0] to retrieve the first element inside. Hashes are a bit different. Items are stored in key and value pairs. Each key is unique and can't contain more than one inside of a hash. For example, to store a key and value inside of `list_hash`, it would be `:name => "Alex"`. Instead of using an index to call this recently added element, you would type list_hash[:name] and it would return "Alex". Elements inside of hashes do not need to be in a specific order because you can just call them by their keys.

          Now that we understand a bit about arrays and hashes, let's see what type of ordered lists would use arrays and unordered lists for hashes. Let's say we're going to buy groceries, we would need to create a list of the items we need to buy and so we use an array to store it. `groceries_array = ["apple", "milk", "butter"]` is an array containing three items. When we get to the grocery store, we would type `groceries_array` and this would print all the items in the array. We see how that can be helpful to store a longer list, but what if we needed three apples and two gallons of milk? This is where a hash would be useful, so lets try using a hash for storing quantities as values and the item names as keys. We would type `groceries_hash = {:apples => 3, :milk=> 2, :butter => 1}` and after we retrieve the entire list by typing `groceries_hash`.

          While learning about arrays and hashes, we may run into difficulties. A great resource is <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/">Ruby-Docs</a>. Ruby-docs provides a list of methods paired with examples. Chris Pine's Learn To Program is a great reading on explaining the concepts. Give it a try and it will be worth it!
