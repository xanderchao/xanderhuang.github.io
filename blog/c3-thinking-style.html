          Prior to beginning Phase 0, we were asked to take the Gregoric Thinking Style survey. This survey provides 15 multiple choices in which we are to seclect the two best characteristics that describe you. After the test, we tally our choices and we are assigned one of the four classes: Concrete Sequential, Concrete Random, Abstract Random and Abstract Sequential. Which of these did I get classified into? It was Concrete Random and it's described as experimenters. Keep in mind this was the result of the second test. On my initial test, I was tied with two thinking styles, Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential. These two are in fact very similar. I believe that results can vary due to different variables: accumulated experience however marginal, mental state and even time of day. As long as results don't vary too much outside of reasonal bounds, it is somewhat accurate.

          Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential Thinkers excel learning on their own, which somewhat frightens me. This is because DBC stresses on pair programming and I want to work well with others. This was listed as one of the hard tasks. I will promise to always keep an open mind in doing so. There are actually a lot of hard tasks for me that are counter-productive to DBC culture. I will only list some of them: expressing their emotions, being diplomatic when convincing others, restrictions and limitations and showing how they got their answers. This list is a mix of both Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential. Sure these cons discourage me a bit, but as long as I strive to work on deviating from the cons I am not that worried. Some of the positives of these styles of thinking are: applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems, able to use trial-and-error approaches (isn't that what programming is all about!) and placed in stimulating environments (just like DBC intensive culture). Now that I know where I fit, I can begin to start molding myself to more positive thinking styles and deviate from the cons or work on them as much as possible to my strength.

          Looking back on the three weeks of Phase 0 so far, I can see a lot of the classifications were spot on. Some of the struggles were re-doing anything once it's done and too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly.I don't recall having difficulties on the challenges it's just that I always feel that I don't completely understand the subject. I have to keep in mind that learning is a marathon and not a sprint to the finish line. What if I manage my time better? What about pair programming more? These are all possible directions and I will create a schedule to make time just for reading the materials, enough so that I can go over a second time. Also I will fit in more pairing sessions with my peers to get better at cooperative thinking. I HAVE to turn my weaknesses into strengths! I will apply a growth mindset and strive to be a well rounded learner.
