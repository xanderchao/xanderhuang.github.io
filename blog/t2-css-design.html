          This week was spent covering HTML and CSS. HTML is a scaffold for content and CSS makes the layout and content look beautiful. The browser interprets the structure of the HTML file and lays it out. This was very straightforward with littl to no issues. The best way to structure your HTML is through following the best practices of HTML5 semantics. Anyways, let's move onto CSS. Most of what the user sees is the styling and positioning of the content, which is done by CSS. We learned earlier that styling can be applied inline and internally. The last and best way is linking your CSS file externally. Why should we do this?
        </p>
        <p>
          The best practice for applying styling is through an external file. This allows the web page to render MUCH quicker, especially if the file is a large. Positioning is important and that's done through CSS. Every element has a margin, border, padding and inside of padding is where the content lies; Imagine a shell inside of a shell and inside of a shell until all there is, is the content. Each of these shells have orientations, top, right, bottom and left. The margin property is where elements interact with one another. One way to apply a margin to an element is element {margin: top, right, bottom, left}. The dimensions can be written in percent(100%) or pixels(100px). This would be the same way for border and padding as well except {margin:} would be {border:} or {padding:}. Border is exactly what it means. It is where the end of the element is. Padding is area where the border and content is. You can expand the content's area or to move content inside of the border by increasing the padding on one side or all sides. It's your choice. Another great thing about CSS is the ability to apply styling to all elements, some chosen ones or even just on specific one. To do this, you would have to assign the element a class or id and call it through CSS.

          <strong>Third Paragraph Goes Here.</strong> Present how you worked through the issues and developed the projects and challenges. How did you overcome the difficulties you had and what resources aided you in your task. Ask yourself, "how could I improve on the solution?" and engage the reader in a question.

          More will be written. I passed the timebox limit, so I will revisit this another day.
